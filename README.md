# Project S.T.O.N.E, Send To OneNote Extension 

You get two commands with this extension:

* Send current document to OneNote
* Send current selection to OneNote

Once you make a selection, a browser window will open, and ask you to grant permission to this extension to create OneNote documents on your behalf. 
Then, I used localhost server to redirect authorization, and finish calling the OneNote API.

If you have a better solution, you are more than welcomed to suggest and contribute to this project at https://github.com/WonSong/STONE.

Thanks!
